"""Truth-Resolver prototype gate.

Resolves whether a proposed action is aligned across the involved actors'
intent / context / value, and net-positive on value. Deterministic pipeline
with the single semantic step (distillation) isolated behind the `Distiller`
interface so an LLM-backed distiller can drop in later without a rewrite.
